# Project-13 Saas landing Page [go-live](https://saas-p-13.netlify.app/)
This is simple website of home page. In this project I have only used core css. It is responsive as well.









## Benifits of making this project.


 - Learned to make responsive we need alot of testing for all screen. Hence making responsive is same as writing css but in different screen.
 - Also learned concept of flexbox.
 - Learned @media query to adjust according to screen.
